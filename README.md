# bakeneko40
40% verison of the bakenkeo40 keyboard by kkatano. 

Changed to be a public repo, but still in WIP. 

Project in semi-pause as I will be fufilling military duties and therefore not be present to work on this.

PCB is still in testing and unconfirmed to work, but otherwise project is mostly done.

Case is a bit too big for plate and pcb. Either edit case or use foam between pcb and plate to allow more room for oring.
