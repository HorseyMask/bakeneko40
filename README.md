# bakeneko40

## On Hold / WIP. Nothing here works (probably), please don't actually try to make this

### Do have interest in working on this again, but still consider this on hold until further work is done.

40% verison of the bakenkeo40 keyboard by kkatano. 

PCB is still in testing and unconfirmed to work, but otherwise project is mostly done.

Case is a bit too big for plate and pcb. Either edit case or use foam between pcb and plate to allow more room for oring.
